# Forecasting Imports and Exports from Port Profiles - CS547 Group Project

A PyTorch-based DNN implementation trained on USDA Shipments Data to forecast agricultural shipments in future. The baseline method used for comparison to DNN is linear regression implemented using sklearn. The code is written on Google Colab and the user simply needs to run all the cells in order to obtain the results; Epoch average loss during training and mean-squared error on testing set are printed by the program.
